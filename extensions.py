Road to Enlightenment
The only things you need to know compared to plain SQLAlchemy are:

    SQLAlchemy gives you access to the following things:
    all the functions and classes from sqlalchemy and sqlalchemy.orm
    a preconfigured scoped session called session
    the metadata
    the engine
    a SQLAlchemy.create_all() and SQLAlchemy.drop_all() methods to create and drop tables according to the models.
    a Model baseclass that is a configured declarative base.
    The Model declarative base class behaves like a regular Python class but has a query attribute attached that can be used to query the model. (Model and BaseQuery)
    You have to commit the session, but you donâ€™t have to remove it at the end of the request, Flask-SQLAlchemy does that for you.



init_app(app)
This callback can be used to initialize an application for the use with this database setup. Never use a database in the context of an application not initialized that way or connections will leak.
